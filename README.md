## E-Commerce Back-End

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create the back-end of an e-commerce site that helps the user get, post, update and delete products/items so they can stay on top of their wares. The app uses object-relational-mapping to capture the data input by the user and updates the site accordingly.

## Installation

Download the files contained in the E-Commerce Back-End repository, either through Github or by making a clone of the repository and downloading it locally. Once the file is downloaded, open it with VS Code or a similar code editor with node js installed. From there, install the node package modules via npm i. Then, select the database in MySQL through source/db.schema.sql and exit MySQL. From there, seed the database with the npm run seed command, and finally enter npm start or node server.js in the command line to start the application.

## Usage

This application is intended for users who want to have a place where they can get, post, update and delete stuff for their e-commerce site.

The user is able to get, post, update and delete the content for each of the categories (category, product and tag). 

## Notes

The main thing I found with this one is to check the syntax, as many of the errors I was experiencing were due to a path being written incorrectly, or a missing parentheses.
